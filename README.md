Trying out the MERN stack for KP Inventory control. The example data is in data/inventory.json.

Decide i needed version conrol because i wanted to go back to previous states.

I had lots of trouble creating this repo.  Biggest being inventory-frontend had a .git in it and git does not like that. So i deleted the git repo and the .git file in the project and redid.

git init\n
git add .\n
git commit -m "Fresh start"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rangle13/MERN-tutorial.git
git push origin main
git push --force origin main

Master did not seem to work. So i tried main and it worked.
