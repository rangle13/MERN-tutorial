Started 6/1/2025 not workung yet.

Trying out the MERN stack for KP Inventory control. The example data is in data/inventory.json.
I had lots of trouble creating this code.  Biggest being inventory-frontend had a .git in it and git does not like that. So i deleted the git repo and the .git file in the project and redid.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rangle13/MERN-tutorial.git
git push origin main
git push --force origin main

Master did not seem to work. So i tried main and it worked.
